## Overview

The theme of the 2024 Annual Meeting addresses how vision research is continually being transformed by new information and technologies. Exponentially expanding computing power is giving rise to improved artificial intelligence and powerful big data. Increasingly sensitive and elegant molecular techniques, including CRISPR and mRNA technologies, as well as more sophisticated imaging modalities, virtual reality, and breakthroughs in gene therapy are catalyzing our research as we aim to treat, cure and ultimately prevent blinding eye diseases.

The EyeACT project will be presenting posters at the ARVO 2024 Annual Meeting. Information about the agenda are as follows:

The theme of the 2024 ARVO Annual Meeting highlights how cutting-edge technologies and groundbreaking discoveries are revolutionizing vision research. Enhanced computational power is driving advancements in artificial intelligence and big data analytics, while molecular innovations such as CRISPR, mRNA technologies, and breakthroughs in gene therapy are transforming the landscape of ophthalmic research. Sophisticated imaging modalities and virtual reality are further catalyzing efforts to prevent, treat, and cure blinding eye diseases.

At this year's ARVO Annual Meeting, the EyeACT project will be showcasing its work in exploring the intersection of eye health and neurodegenerative diseases. Through poster presentations, the EyeACT team will unveil their latest findings on how retinal biomarkers, advanced imaging techniques, and long-term data analysis are advancing the early detection and prevention of Alzheimer's disease.

Join us at ARVO 2024 to learn more about how EyeACT is shaping the future of vision and brain health research.
